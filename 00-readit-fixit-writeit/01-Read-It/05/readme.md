* The for-loop is no longer present. 
  What was it replaced with? How does this work?
* What does the function 'parseTitle' do? 
  What parameter do we pass to this function?
* What does the function 'wrapWithTag' do? 
  Why are the parameters placed between brackets?


The for-loop is replaced with the forEach() method.
The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each array element.

The parseTitle makes every list item lower case. We pass it all the movie titles (list items).

The wrapWithTag makes all the titles list items by wrapping them in <li> and </li> tags.
Multiple parameters require parentheses.
